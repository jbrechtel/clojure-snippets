;; Rules from Wikipedia
;; 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by needs caused by underpopulation.
;; 2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
;; 3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.
;; 4. Any tile with exactly three live neighbours cells will be populated with a living cell.
